# Sample configuration for a distributed Kafka Connect worker that uses Avro serialization and

# The group ID is a unique identifier for the set of workers that form a single Kafka Connect
# cluster

# Internal Storage Topics.
#
# Kafka Connect distributed workers store the connector and task configurations, connector offsets,
# and connector statuses in three internal topics. These topics MUST be compacted.
# When the Kafka Connect distributed worker starts, it will check for these topics and attempt to create them
# as compacted topics if they don't yet exist, using the topic name, replication factor, and number of partitions
# as specified in these properties, and other topic-specific settings inherited from your brokers'
# auto-creation settings. If you need more control over these other topic-specific settings, you may want to
# manually create these topics before starting Kafka Connect distributed workers.
#
# The following properties set the names of these three internal topics for storing configs, offsets, and status.
config.storage.topic=connect-configs
offset.storage.topic=connect-offsets
status.storage.topic=connect-statuses

# The following properties set the replication factor for the three internal topics, defaulting to 3 for each
# and therefore requiring a minimum of 3 brokers in the cluster. Since we want the examples to run with
# only a single broker, we set the replication factor here to just 1. That's okay for the examples, but
# ALWAYS use a replication factor of AT LEAST 3 for production environments to reduce the risk of 
# losing connector offsets, configurations, and status.
config.storage.replication.factor=1
offset.storage.replication.factor=1
status.storage.replication.factor=1

# The config storage topic must have a single partition, and this cannot be changed via properties. 
# Offsets for all connectors and tasks are written quite frequently and therefore the offset topic
# should be highly partitioned; by default it is created with 25 partitions, but adjust accordingly
# with the number of connector tasks deployed to a distributed worker cluster. Kafka Connect records
# the status less frequently, and so by default the topic is created with 5 partitions.
#offset.storage.partitions=25
#status.storage.partitions=5

# The offsets, status, and configurations are written to the topics using converters specified through
# the following required properties. Most users will always want to use the JSON converter without schemas. 
# Offset and config data is never visible outside of Connect in this format.
