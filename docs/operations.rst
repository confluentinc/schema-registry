Schema Registry Operations
==========================

In this document, you will learn how to manage a Schema Registry cluster.

Here, we will cover two main topics:

* Deploying your cluster to production, including best practices and important configuration that
  should (or should not!) be changed
* Monitoring your cluster’s vital statistics, understanding which behaviors are normal and which
  should be cause for alarm, and interpreting various stats provided by Schema Registry
