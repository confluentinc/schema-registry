Schema Registry
================

Schema Registry is part of the `Confluent Open Source <https://www.confluent.io/product/confluent-open-source/>`_ and `Confluent Enterprise <https://www.confluent.io/product/confluent-enterprise/>`_ distributions.  The Schema Registry stores a versioned history of all schemas and allows for the evolution of schemas according to the configured compatibility settings and expanded Avro support.
